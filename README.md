# Simpe GMMK Pro Rev1 ANSI Layout

## Changelog

- Rotary Encoder button changed from 'Mute' to 'Play/Pause'
- 'Print-screen' changed to 'Insert'
- 'MO(1)' changed to 'Right Windows' 
- Removed Layer 1
    - Initially added to allow entering DFU Bootloader mode. This can easily be done by holding ESC when plugging the keyboard.
    - Also allows swapping between NKRO and 6KRO, but I don't really mind 6KRO.
